1. “How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?”

To write programs that can follow as being maintainable, readable, and adaptable is to write them in a modular manner. This means breaking everything down into smaller components, such as methods, and calling those methods instead of placing everything in the main thread. This allows for the programmer to make new changes through only one area instead of multiple. 

In terms of creating the CRUD code, I did this by creating a Database Error class and a class for the CRUD code. The second class then contained 5 methods that allowed me to have one place for each of the 5 elements required, create, read, update, delete, and access a database session. This meant that I didn’t need to type it out every time and only had to call it by calling the file itself.

The advantage to all of this is that I only have to search in one file and one spot to make any changes to my code. I’m not going to have to go through multiple files, but this can also work well for systems that are using many different coding languages at once. For my CRUD code itself, I can use this in an interactive fiction that I am currently making, because there is a database in that game that will need to create, update, delete, and read these different items, player name, levels, and so on.

2. “How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?”

My approach to the problem is multi-leveled. I start by figuring out what is being asked for as the final product. From there, I ask what are the requirements that are needed. I then break it down into smaller components from to figure out how each requirement can be created, fixed, worked out, and so on. I will often make flowcharts to find the interactions and I’ll ask the questions needed to get as much information as possible.

With the project that was created for Grazioso Salvare, my biggest approach was starting earlier than I had in the past. In the past, I was often doing the project the week of. This time I started it earlier. I did more research into the different areas to understand how the dash framework worked and looked over what I did. Since we had to do multiple tests on our code in the past, I was able to more easily build up my project and have more information. As for my techniques for future projects, I’ll definitely be asking even more questions so that I can ensure the final product comes out as desired.

3. “What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?”


To be the most specific, I’ll take this quote from Michigan Technical University, “Computer scientists design, develop, and analyze the software and hardware used to solve problems in all kinds of business, industry, scientific, and social contexts” (Michigan Technological University, 2024). This is important in that technology is a big part of our world and we need the computer scientists to understand how it works and how it can be improved upon to better help the world. In the case of this project for Grazioso Salvare, this database and dash framework helps them in keeping all of their workers up to date, better help train animals to save people in different types of rescues, and also maintain those that they already have. This improves the working conditions for both the animals and humans. There is also the added benefit of them being able to possibly help give animals that may not have anything a better shot in life while maintaining organization in their own systems.
